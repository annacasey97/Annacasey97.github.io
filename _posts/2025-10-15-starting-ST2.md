I’ve been thinking recently about competence. What does it mean? From the very start of training, the binary “competent” / “working towards competence” has been a stressful yet mandatory question for the OSAT assessments of the RCOG portfolio. Am I competent if I can do the CS but not solve any problems (bleeding, tone etc)? Where does this end, though? An ST2 cannot reasonably be expected to perform an emergency hysterectomy, after all, though they will need to be "competent" to perform a CS.

# Do-Recognise-Escalate

I remember asking a consultant about this last year. Their suggestion was to look at levels of safety - can I **do** the thing, **recognise** potential common issues and **escalate** once it is clear I can’t manage them myself? I would argue there is more to it than this. Recently, one year to the date from my first skin to skin Caesarean section, I did two elective CS, assisted by a medical student for closure from the uterus up. Is this competence? 

# Operator/assistant competence balance

On discussion with the consultant supervising this (and signing my OSATs!), she suggested a different mental model: **operator/assistant competence balance**. Basically, when I first started, in terms of theory and technical skill I was uncertain, but my assistants always knew what they were doing; they were competent, I was working towards it. Now, I have apparently reached a stage (per this consultant) where both I and my assistant are reliably competent. The next step is becoming competent when my assistant is not; an FY, a GPST, a student. Eventually, an ST1-2.

# Mindset and changing attitudes to procedures

After these two sections, I was yapping with some colleagues in the office. One of them is an immensely senior ST7 who knows everything. His thoughts were that operating is **more “mindful” than “handful”**. We do, after all, suture the same way. The difference between him and I, is apparently to do with anticipation of problems, planning for these and having an option A, B, C and D.

A different colleague whom I look up to was reflecting on an experience where she was struggling, and felt she needed a "nice straightforward" CS experience to feel better about herself. She was remembering when performing CS was terrifying to her, and thinking how this procedure is now a comfortable space for her, indeed a source of comfort when learning new procedures leaves her feeling inadequate. This will doubtless continue to happen with various skills in our craft specialty.

# What else does this apply to?

I remember thinking that learning more about uterine cancer had me feeling incredibly stupid. Every sentence seemed to contain a new word or concept, which could only be elucidated by reading, like, three more papers. I then had a realisation that this was only my “known unknowns” expanding - they had always been unknown, I just didn’t know they were things someone could know. Everything is like this. 

I remember being really impressed by a consultant easily juggling several facts about a patient at handover to come up with predictions and a plan, where I was struggling to think past one individual issue. She knew things, and was able to think, in a way I did not realise it was possible to know or think. That’s competent, surely. But even she! Even she is (probably) not able to solve every problem, or anticipate every issue.

# How else could we think about competence?

Maybe competence is a bit like capacity - **situation-dependent**. Sure, I’m competent in some ways, but this relies on me being **able to see where I’m not competent** - to recognise when I’m discovering new unknowns and escalate this. I also need to have the confidence and security to say “hey, I don’t know what’s happening” and trust that my team will catch me.

# Seniority and competence

It’s not natural for me to think of myself as more competent than someone else. I am not yet used to being more senior than anyone else. Thus, it sometimes comes as a bit of a shock when more junior colleagues are struggling with things I used to struggle with but no longer do (as much) - things like reviewing sick patients, or handing over at the end of a shift. I used to be terrified of updating families, now I am merrily enquiring as to where husbands got their glasses from - my antiscratch coating is coming off and I fear it looks unprofessional. The shock comes from the fact that I have not reflected on these things, and am surprised when I’m able to give advice which seems to work. I haven’t seen myself become competent, but it seems to have happened anyway. Now, I can see that other people think I’m competent. When did that happen? Clearly, self-reflection is not always prerequisite.

Nevertheless, in order to be aware of your known unknowns increasing, you need to have some degree of reflection in the moment. This can be difficult in situations where your mental energy is mainly focussed on not causing too much damage! Deep philosophising can come later, I suppose.
How do I cultivate being aware of my awareness increasing? It’s certainly uncomfortable - I felt so stupid for a good few months of starting my gynae-oncology research work. Supremely uncomfortable - and of course initially I felt it must be my fault for being an idiot and not coping. I think that experience has helped me, though - when I feel like that, I think to myself: what am I learning? Is this a new knowledge boundary? Have I reached the edge of my extant awareness and am now venturing merrily forth into terra incognita? Here be dragons consultants?
The other thing I think is: if I can’t continue with my current knowledge, I need to ask for help. This will have to become instinctive as I become expected to do more urgent things. Example: “I can’t deliver this head, please take over”. I am fortunate I am surrounded by excellent colleagues who are more than willing to help.
This week I’ve also seen this in action from a consultant - “I’m not confident I can release these ureters from these adhesions, please check who is on from gynae-onc/urogynae and ask them to come and help.”
