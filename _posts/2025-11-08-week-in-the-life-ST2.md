# What does a week as an ST2 Obstetrics and Gynaecology look like?

I thought I'd make a post about what a week in the life looks like. Recently I had a 'standard week' - basically, all my days were 'standard'. In my current post this means from 8am to 5pm (paid until 5.30 to account for handover).

Some weeks are consumed by long days (8-8), or nights (the other 8-8), which are pretty repetitive so I wanted to show more of the in-hours activity I'm involved in.

# Monday

On Monday I was in gynaecology theatres, assisting my consultant and registrar. This mainly involved sitting down the 'bottom end', and manipulating the uterus during laparoscopic surgery. My registrar had to leave at 5, but the list was running until 8, so I stayed late as a locum to complete the list, and I got to assist more actively - holding the camera, and getting to do an endometrial biopsy during a GA hysteroscopy.

# Tuesday

On Tuesday I was in GAU. This means attending the ward round, seeing new attenders to the assessment part of the unit, and assisting in theatre (though I didn't actually go that particular day). Ward patients are typically either post-op (e.g. salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy) or admitted for pain relief and investigation. Pain and bleeding are probably the main 2 symptoms we see, and of course they have a massive differential diagnosis so unless the history and examination is clearly indicating a diagnosis, sometimes more investigations are needed either as inpatients for acutely unwell people, or outpatients where there is a bit more time.

# Wednesday

Wednesday was an academic day for me - the whole week had originally been academic but my supervisor and I felt that keeping the time more limited now would be useful for the future when I'm likely to want more concentrated time. I focussed on a systematic review I'm writing, and tried to make contact with a potential interview participant.

# Thursday

This was a shift covering the postnatal wards and MAU, the 'maternity assessment unit'. This is basically like A+E for maternity, which in my Trust starts at 16 weeks (rather than being seen under gynaecology for your urgent health concerns). The two main problems I reckon, or rather the most common ones, are reduced fetal movements and abdominal pain. Sometimes people come in to be assessed if they think their waters may have gone, or if they are worried they might be in labour. Other times it's because of bleeding, or some other problem like headaches. It's really quite varied!

# Friday

I was on the elective C section list to finish the week - I really like these as they tend to be a) possible for me to do under consultant supervision which is great for developing my confidence, and b) potentially clinically more complicated due to the indication for the CS. This means I get to practice my CS skills, as well as learn about more complex skills I could develop. I got to do 2 out of the 4 cases, which I was pretty happy with - the others were definitely more suited to a consultant skill level!

I hope this has shed some light on what an 'example week' might look like - it's really pretty varied so my next 'standard week' might involve completely different things. A lot of decisions around who goes where depend on things like level of staffing, sickness absences and training requirements for the trainees, so it will differ quite a lot potentially. Overall I think this particular week was a good mix of everything, so I was pretty happy.
