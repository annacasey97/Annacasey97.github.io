What does it mean? From the very start of training, the binary “competent” / “working towards competence” has been a stressful yet mandatory question for the OSAT assessments of the RCOG portfolio. Am I competent if I can do the CS but not solve any problems (bleeding, tone etc)? Where does this end, though? An ST2 cannot reasonably be expected to perform an emergency hysterectomy, after all, though they will need to be “competent” to perform a CS.</p> <h1 id="what-triggered-this">What triggered this?</h1> <p>Recently, one year to the date from my first skin to skin Caesarean section, I did two elective CS, assisted by a medical student for closure from the uterus up. Is this competence?</p> <h1 id="do-recognise-escalate">Do-Recognise-Escalate</h1> <p>I remember asking a consultant about this last year. Their suggestion was to look at levels of safety - can I <strong>do</strong> the thing, <strong>recognise</strong> potential common issues and <strong>escalate</strong> once it is clear I can’t manage them myself? I would argue there is more to it than this.</p> <h1 id="operatorassistant-competence-balance">Operator/assistant competence balance</h1> <p>On discussion with the consultant supervising the recent CS with a student (and signing my OSATs!), she suggested a different mental model: <strong>operator/assistant competence balance</strong>. Basically, when I first started, in terms of theory and technical skill I was uncertain, but my assistants always knew what they were doing; they were competent, I was working towards it. Now, I have apparently reached a stage (per this consultant) where both I and my assistant are reliably competent. The next step is becoming competent when my assistant is not; an FY, a GPST, a student. Eventually, an ST1-2.</p> <h1 id="mindset-and-changing-attitudes-to-procedures">Mindset and changing attitudes to procedures</h1> <p>After these two sections, I was yapping with some colleagues in the office. One of them is an immensely senior ST7 who knows everything. His thoughts were that operating is <strong>more “mindful” than “handful”</strong>. We do, after all, suture the same way. The difference between him and I, is apparently to do with anticipation of problems, planning for these and having an option A, B, C and D.</p> <p>A different colleague whom I look up to was reflecting on an experience where she was struggling, and felt she needed a “nice straightforward” CS experience to feel better about herself. She was remembering when performing CS was terrifying to her, and thinking how this procedure is now a comfortable space for her, indeed a source of comfort when learning new procedures leaves her feeling inadequate. This will doubtless continue to happen with various skills in our craft specialty.</p> <h1 id="what-else-does-this-apply-to">What else does this apply to?</h1> <p>I remember thinking that learning more about uterine cancer had me feeling incredibly stupid. Every sentence seemed to contain a new word or concept, which could only be elucidated by reading, like, three more papers. I then had a realisation that this was only my “known unknowns” expanding - they had always been unknown, I just didn’t know they were things someone <strong>could know</strong>. Everything is like this.</p> <p>I remember being really impressed by a consultant easily juggling several facts about a patient at handover to come up with predictions and a plan, where I was struggling to think past one individual issue. She knew things, and was able to think, in a way I did not realise it was possible to know or think. That’s competent, surely. But even she! Even she is (probably) not able to solve every problem, or anticipate every issue.</p> <h1 id="how-else-could-we-think-about-competence">How else could we think about competence?</h1> <p>Maybe competence is a bit like capacity - <strong>situation-dependent</strong>. Sure, I’m competent in some ways, but this relies on me being <strong>able to see where I’m not competent</strong> - to recognise when I’m discovering new unknowns and escalate this. I also need to have the confidence and security to say “hey, I don’t know what’s happening” and trust that my team will catch me. The other week I saw this in action from a consultant - “I’m not confident I can release these ureters from these adhesions, please check who is on from gynae-onc/urogynae and ask them to come and help.”</p> <h1 id="seniority-and-competence">Seniority and competence</h1> <p>Since starting ST2, I’ve found myself in the position of being more senior than other people more directly than ever before. I’m not used to this, and am sometimes surprised at how people approach me for advice. This is especially jarring when it’s for things I used to really struggle with - for example, reviewing sick patients, or handing over at the end of a shift. I haven’t noticed myself becoming competent, but nevertheless it seems to have happened, even without the constant self-reflection described above.</p> <p>Nevertheless, in order to be aware of your known unknowns increasing, you need to have some degree of reflection in the moment. This can be difficult in situations where your mental energy is mainly focussed on not causing too much damage!</p> <p>My experience of the 2 CS with student assistance was night/day compared with an early experience in my CS competence. It was an on call shift, and my registrar had allowed me to perform 2 CS, which was the first time I’d ever done that. During one of them, I invited a medical student to be the second assistant, as a learning opportunity. I apologised for not doing a great deal of teaching, because I was so focussed on the procedure itself, though my registrar commented in my OSAT that I’d actually demonstrated (apparently) good situational awareness and created mental space for teaching. I wasn’t too sure of that, but a win is a win. This time, with the student assisting, I was able to teach some anatomy, surgical prinicples and I’m sure other things she absorbed from the experience - turns out it was actually her first ever CS!</p> <h1 id="wrapping-up-what-can-i-do-to-reflect-on-this-process">Wrapping up: what can I do to reflect on this process?</h1> <p>How do I cultivate being aware of my awareness increasing? It’s certainly uncomfortable - I felt so stupid for a good few months of starting my gynae-oncology research work. Supremely uncomfortable - and of course initially I felt it must be my fault for being an idiot and not coping. I think that experience has helped me, though - when I feel like that, I think to myself: what am I learning? Is this a new knowledge boundary? Have I reached the edge of my extant awareness and am now venturing merrily forth into terra incognita? Hic sunt consultants?</p> <p>A final thought from one of my colleagues (I learn so much from them) - she, on a recent night shift, advised me to keep a journal. I already had one, but I’ve been trying to reflect more on my shifts in it, in order to compare myself now with myself in X years. I regret not writing more reflections in my diary from FY1/2, and want to remember how I felt now when I am further along the journey.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/week-in-the-life-ST2/">week in the life - ST2, Nov 2025</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/BGCS2025/">BGCS Annual Scientific Meeting 2025</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/starting-in-research/">Starting in research</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/MRCOG-reflections/">MRCOG reflections</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/meeting-people/">research at medical school - meeting people</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2025 Dr Anna Casey.
